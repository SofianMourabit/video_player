      <span class="caption-1">Now that we've looked at the architecture
        of the internet, let's see how you might</span> <span class="caption-2">connect your personal devices to
          the internet inside your house.</span> <span class="caption-3">Well there are many ways to
            connect to the internet, and</span> <span class="caption-4">most often people connect wirelessly.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="caption-5">Let's look at an example of how
              you can connect to the internet.</span> <span class="caption-6">If you live in a city or a town,
                you probably have a coaxial cable for</span> <span class="caption-7">cable Internet, or a phone line if you
                  have DSL, running to the outside of</span> <span class="caption-8">your house, that connects you to
                    the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.</span> <span class="caption-9">If you live far out in the country,
                      you'll more likely have</span> <span class="caption-10">a dish outside your house, connecting
                        you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or</span> <span class="caption-11">you might also use the telephone system.</span>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <span class="caption-12">Whether a wire comes straight from
                          the ISP hookup outside your house, or</span> <span class="caption-13">it travels over radio
                            waves from your roof,</span> <span class="caption-14">the first stop a wire will make once
                              inside your house, is at your modem.</span> <span class="caption-15">A modem is what connects the internet
                                to your network at home.</span> <span class="caption-16">A few common residential modems are DSL or</span>
